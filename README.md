# pomfblaze
 Porting PomfSharp to Blazor.

This is a clone of <a href="https://github.com/pomf/pomf">pomf</a> written in <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>.

# tech stack
Planned tech stack so far is ASP .Net Core, Blazor and PostgreSQL. Some kind of caching may be used but I am undecided on this. May also include Akka.NET to handle different actions in the backend. Undecided whether this will be hosted anywhere yet, although I think it would be cool to include running the project in Docker and be able to deploy the container to Azure/AWS/GCP/somewhere else!

# live coding
I will be streaming most of the development on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wooffet">twitch</a>, feel free to come say hello!
